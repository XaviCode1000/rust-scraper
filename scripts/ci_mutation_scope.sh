# ci_mutation_scope.sh — Phase 4 mutation scope advisor (risk engine input).
#
# Recommends WHICH area paths to mutate from the change scope. Advisory only:
# it never gates, never fails (exit 0 always), runs no cargo, touches no
# network — it only shells out to scripts/ci_path_classifier.sh.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ci_mutation_scope.sh [--base-ref <ref>] [--head-ref <ref>]
#                                [--base <ref>] [--head <ref>]
#                                [--files <newline-separated-list>]
#   CI_MUTATION_SCOPE_FILES=<list> scripts/ci_mutation_scope.sh
#
# Output (stdout, human-readable + greppable `key=value` first lines):
#   mutation-scope: needs_mutation_hotpath=<true|false>
#   hotpath-areas: <csv of core,crawler,downloader,ai | none>
#   then either `scope-paths:` (one path glob per line) or
#   `scope: none` + `reason: ...`.
#
# Consistency with the mutants workflow (.github/workflows/mutants.yml):
#   the `mutants-pr` job greps the PR diff for exactly these 6 hot paths
#   (mirrored in .cargo/mutants.toml `examine_globs`):
#     crates/webfang_core/src/application/crawler/
#     crates/webfang_core/src/application/pipeline/
#     crates/webfang_core/src/extractor/
#     crates/webfang_core/src/infrastructure/bridge.rs
#     crates/webfang_core/src/infrastructure/http/waf_engine.rs
#     crates/webfang_core/src/infrastructure/network/
#   This helper recommends that SAME set (as `/**` globs), partitioned by
#   classifier area so the scope stays proportional to the change:
#     crawler area    -> application/crawler/** + application/pipeline/**
#                        + extractor/**
#     downloader area -> infrastructure/network/** + waf_engine.rs + bridge.rs
#     core area       -> the FULL 6-path set (conservative: see delta 1)
#     ai area         -> crates/webfang_ai/** (advisory; see delta 3)
#
# Documented deltas (classifier is filename-broad, mutants gate is exact):
#   1. `core_changed` covers ALL of crates/webfang_core/**, but the mutants
#      gate only watches the 6 paths above. A pure-domain change (e.g.
#      value_objects.rs) sets needs_mutation_hotpath=true here while the
#      mutants-pr grep reports hotpath-changed=false. Conservative direction:
#      this helper recommends the full gated set so the risk engine reviews
#      the hot paths, never less.
#   2. The classifier `downloader` predicate is broader than the gate: it
#      also matches ssrf/guard_chain/cookie_bridge/hybrid_router/spa_detector/
#      resource_governor substrings anywhere in the tree. Files matching only
#      those (outside the 3 gated downloader paths) still recommend the 3
#      gated paths — guard order is load-bearing, so any guard-adjacent
#      change deserves the gated scope.
#   3. The classifier `ai` predicate (crates/webfang_ai/** + model markers)
#      has NO counterpart in the current mutants workflow, which runs
#      `cargo mutants -p webfang_core` only. An ai-only change is reported
#      with scope-path `crates/webfang_ai/**` flagged as OUT-OF-CURRENT-SCOPE
#      (future lane, not today's mutants-pr gate). Blocking semantics of
#      mutants.yml are unchanged by this phase.
#
# Exit code: always 0 (advisory). Classifier failure degrades to
# needs_mutation_hotpath=true (fail closed to the full gated set).
